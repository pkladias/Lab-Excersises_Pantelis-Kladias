        <h2>Early Life</h2>
            <p class= "paragraph">
                Giannis Antetokounmpo was born in Athens, Greece, on December 6 1994. 
                He is the son of immigrants from Nigeria. The part of Athens in which he is from is called Sepolia.
                 A neighborhood comprised mostly of immigrants. Because his parents were immigrants and could not easily find work, Giannis and his three brothers: Kostas, Thanasis, and Alex had to sell watches, handbags and other goods on the streets to make ends meet.

            <p>Giannis talents was discovered in a very unlikely way. He was playing basketball at a playground when a Basletball coach, Spiros Villiniates, saw him playing and recruited him.
                Giannis began his senior professional basketball career with Filathlitkos who play in the Greek B Basket League.
                He played with Filathlitkos until 2013. It was at this point he had become scouted by NBA scouts. Due to the prominence of other international players more NBA teams began to scout overseas which allowed him to become discovered.

            <p>As he was being discovered he was asked by a reporter what his dream was and Giannis replied, "to be an NBA player"

        <h3>All Star Selections and MVP</h3>

Unfortunately, the team ended up losing the series 4-2, however, behind Antetokounmpo's leadership and fantastic play the team's future was bright.
            In 2017-2018 Giannis again went on a tear leading his team to the playoffs and making the NBA All star game. Despite his personal success, his team again fell short in the playoffs, this time to the Boston Celtics in Game 7 of the first round.
            In 2018-2019 Giannis won his first MVP award after leading the Bucks to the first seed in the Eastern conference while averaging nearly 30 points per game.
            The Bucks had a good run in the playoffs making it all the way to the Eastern confernece finals where they took a 2-0 lead over the Toronto Raptors. Unfortunately, the Raptors then won 4 straight to beat the Bucks in 6 games.

        <h4>Covid Year</h4>
        <p>
            The Bucks started the 2019-2020 season extremly strong at 25-4 and Giannis was named All Star Captain once again. However, the NBA season was then shut down due to the COVID Pandemic.
            Play resumed in a bubble format in Orlando where only the playoff teams competed and no outside persons were allowed.
            The Bucks defeated the Magic in the first round of the playoffs but they then lost to the Miami heat in the second round after Antetokounmpo got injured during Game 4.
            This was seen as a devastating loss and many questioned if Antetokounmpo could win a NBA Championship

        <h3>NBA Championsip(2020-2021)</h3>
        <p>
            The Bucks began the season as one of the main contenders for the title. After their loss to the Heat the teams made a trade to acquire Jrue Holidy to bolster their squad.
            Holiday is one of the leagues best perimeter defenders and a capable scorer. The Bucks big three of Holidy, Middleton, and Antetokounmpo led the Bucks to the third seed in the Eastern conference. 
            Antetokounmpo was once again named an All star. In the first round of the playoffs the Bucks faced the Miami Heat, the team that had defeated them the year prior. This year however, was the Bucks year and they swept the Heat 4-0.
            In the Second round the Bucks faced the Brooklyn Nets in a nail bitting series that the Bucks won in 7 games 4-3.
            In the Eastern Conference Finals the Bucks faced the Atlanta Hawks whom they defeated in 6 games 4-2. Antetokounmpo was injured and missed Games 5 and 6 but the Bucks improved roster was able to win without him.
            The Bucks faced the Phoenix Suns in the NBA Finals. The Suns took a 2-0 lead over the Bucks and it seemed like the Bucks were to fall short again. However, Giannis went on a tear and the Bucks won 4 straight to claim the championship.
            Antetokounmpo put up historic numbers and played fantastic which led to him winning NBA Finals MVP.
